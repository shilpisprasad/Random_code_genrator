Type: User selects the type of characters to include in the code:
    Mixed: Letters (uppercase & lowercase) + Numbers

    Numbers: Only numeric characters (0-9)

### Output:
A randomly generated code based on the specified length and character type.
The code is displayed on the page without reloading, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Features:

Real-time random code generation upon button click.
Error messages displayed if input is invalid (e.g., length out of range).
No page reload due to JavaScript handling the code generation dynamically.

### Technologies Used:
